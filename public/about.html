            <p>I graduated from Galgotias University in August 2023 with a B.Tech in Computer Science, achieving a GPA of 8.08/10. Following my Graduation I joined Cubastion Consulting as a Graduate Trainee Engineer from October 2023 .

During my time at Cubastion Consulting, I collaborated on the implementation and configuration of Oracle Siebel CRM solutions. This role provided me with hands-on experience in deploying and maintaining customer relationship management systems. I demonstrated a proactive approach to learning and adapting to new technologies, contributing to the successful implementation of CRM solutions. Additionally, I worked closely with cross-functional teams to overcome errors, fostering effective communication and teamwork.</p>
